# Overview
This project is an interactive dashboard that provides real-time audio signal visualization and speech-to-text transcription. It allows users to:
- Monitor and visualize live audio data in real-time.
- View key audio features like dB level, waveform, and spectrogram.
- Convert live audio into text using speech recognition.
- Save the captured data (including audio statistics and transcriptions) to a CSV file.
- The dashboard is built using Dash (for the web interface) and integrates with Python libraries such as Plotly for graphing, pyaudio for real-time audio stream handling, and SpeechRecognition for transcription.
